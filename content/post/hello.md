# -> Utilising Loopback

## Objective

* Demonstrate a versatile, seamless, secure  and stable  solution that will can allow the simple construction of new  interface capabilit in the form of APIs whose objective is to provide multichannel Enterprise Integration between the external world and a corporation's existing main core CRM platform

* The following sections should convey the  simplistic alternative approach to building an interface, where the need for expensive and cumbersome server hosted middleware can be dispensed with altogether.

* In this example we will show how to  provide automated onboarding functionality for new customers.

* The solution will, in particular, demonstrate the expert application of Loopback® Framework that can host a whole range of  RESTful  services underpinned using  Node.Java scripted logic.


## Key Components
1. Azure Cloud platform


2. Loopback® (by IBM) Framework


3. Node.J Script


4. Existing Corporation's core CRM System (e.g. Oracle Siebel® implementation)



### (1) Azure Cloud Platform

* Connect other services without hard-coding integrations for faster solutions!

* Create an eliable server-less application with built-in security and monitoring. Capabilities:

* Monitor and analyse code performance with Azure Application Insights. Spot bottlenecks and failure hotspots across all components of your application using application maps with distributed tracing , using Azure Monitor.

* Source application settings with full control over access policies and audit history –without making code changes 

* Isolate networks through virtual network connectivity on the Functions Premium plan, enabling outbound traffic into a secured virtual network gating incoming traffic and defining app restrictions.

* Configure managed identities at the service level to let applications easily access other resources protected by Azure Active Directory.

* Grant access to your application using built-in authentication with Azure Active Directory, Microsoft account, and external providers such as Twitter, Facebook and Google.

* Messaging Queue capbility, stacking all requests and responses direct from the CRM system. In this example a core Entreprise Siebel CRM system. 

* Quick and easy capability program flow and power that can consume any core system RESTful or SOAP service, to provide the most simplistic routines for an customer or end user interaction

* Development and deployment is quick simple and lightening fast to deploy.
 
* Maintenance and support so easy!

* Eliminate the need for costly server hosted middleware applications
